# My-RISC-V-Learning-Journey
Documenting my RISC-V learning journey
# Week 0 â€“ Task 0

## ðŸ”¹ Introduction  
This is the starting point of my **RISC-V SoC learning journey**.  
The objective of **Week 0** is to:  
## Set up a working environment
- System requirement
   6 GB RAM
   50 GB HDD
   Ubuntu 25.04
   4 vCPU
- Organize the repository  
- Understand the workflow with GitHub  

## ðŸ”¹ Goals of Week 0  
- Install and configure Linux environment  
- Set up Git and connect with GitHub using PAT  
- Install open-source VLSI/EDA tools  
- Create structured folders for weekly tasks  
- Document progress in a professional manner 

## ðŸ”¹ System Setup  

**OS:** Ubuntu 25.04 LTS (fresh installation)  
**Version Control:** GitHub (via HTTPS + PAT)  

**Tools Installed:**  
- Magic â€“ Layout tool  
- Netgen â€“ LVS tool  
- Qrouter â€“ Detailed routing tool  
- Qflow â€“ Digital synthesis flow manager  
- OpenSTA â€“ Static timing analysis  
- Gtkwave â€“ Waveform viewer
- Yosys â€“ Logic synthesis  
- Icarus Verilog â€“ RTL simulation  
- Others: Make, GCC, Nano/VS Code, supporting libraries  


## ðŸ”¹ Tasks Completed  
1. Installed Ubuntu successfully  
2. Installed open-source EDA toolchain (Magic, Netgen, Qrouter, etc.)  
3. Configured Git + GitHub authentication (PAT)  
4. Created repo structure â†’ `Week0/Task0/`  
5. Wrote initial `README.md` documenting setup  


## ðŸ”¹ Learnings  
- How to authenticate GitHub using PAT  
- Basic Git workflow: `clone â†’ add â†’ commit â†’ push`  
- Installing and configuring open-source VLSI tools  
- Importance of organizing work week by week  
- Writing `README` files to track progress
